		Now using VS Code (Visual Studio Code) for Java interface instead of Eclipse. Changed due to FIRST moving to it. Below is the link to download VS Code 
		and all resources required for FIRST. Also linked below is a video guiding you through the instalation of GIT, as it is required in VS Code to pull things
		from GitHub.

		Guide from FIRST for VS Code and resource instalation: https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/79833/l/932382-installing-vs-code
